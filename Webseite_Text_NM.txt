I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the DFG Funded Project “Cognitive Rational Reconstruction (KoRaRe)” at Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf.  IN October 2025, I will begin my own DFG-funded research position with the project “Trust and Trustworthiness and their Implications for Testimony and Epistemic Authority” at Technische Universität Berlin.   Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Humboldt Universität zu Berlin in the research training Group “Philosophy Science and the Sciences”. I received my PhD from Freie Universität Berlin under the supervision of Dirk Koppelberg and Barbara Vetter.  Here is my full CV. 
My research focuses on epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind.
